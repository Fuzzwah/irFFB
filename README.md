# irFFB

irFFB can feed the 360 Hz steering column torque data recently made available in iRacing telemetry to your wheel, upsample and apply low-latency digital filters to the standard (60 Hz) iRacing FFB output and modify the feedback via a number of effects based on live telemetry.

It can also drive a 'Jetseat' and fans if you have them.

There's more detail in the wiki..

**Please Note** I no longer use this myself and as you can see I haven't updated it since 2022. I've archived the repo. You may be interested in checking out [Marvin's Awesome iRacing App](https://github.com/mherbold/MarvinsAIRARefactored) which is what I've been using recently. Else, iRacing FFB has improved a lot since irFFB was a thing.....
